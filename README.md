# cs-wiper

part 2

rewrite of my [python wiper](https://github.com/gnay-uy/py-wiper) in csharp with regfuck baked in (for fun)

## disclaimer
i made this with no malicious intent, its purely for eduational purposes, and i will take no responsibility for any damage caused by the use of this program.

while this is a wiper, i __cannot__ guarantee that it will securely erase your disk. if you want your data gone for food, **take a hammer to your drive** and leave it in the microwave for 45 seconds, then put into an airfryer at 350C for 8 minutes, and lastly, coat with egg and breadcrumbs and deep fry until golden brown.

## how to use
compile the program yourself, i don't want to distribute the binary
